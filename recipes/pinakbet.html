        <h3>Description</h3>
        <strong>Pinakbet</strong>  or Pakbet is a Filipino vegetable stew from the Ilocos region. Its name is derived from the Ilocano word pinakebbet which means “shriveled”, in reference to the vegetables being sweated in the pot over low heat until “shrunken”.

</br></br>

        The dish makes use of indigenous produce, root crops, and beans that are accessible and plentiful in the area such as okra, ginger, tomatoes, eggplant, ampalaya, sitaw, siling duwag, and kamote. It’s traditionally flavored with bagoong monamon, a type of seasoning made of fermented fish. Other ingredients such as diced pork, crispy bagnet, shrimp or pre-cooked fish are added for flavor.

</br></br>

        While pakbet originated in the northern part of the country, a Pinakbet Tagalog version is also popular in the southern areas. This regional variation derives its characteristic taste from bagoong alamang or shrimp paste instead of bagoong isda and usually includes kalabasa for a touch of sweetness.
