        <h3>Description</h3>
        <strong>Halo-halo</strong> , which translates to “mix-mix,” is said to have originated from the Japanese shaved ice, kakigori, and was brought to our shores by Japanese migrants who settled near the ice manufacturing plant in Quinta, Manila Philippines.

</br></br>

        This Filipino cold dessert is made with sweetened beans, fruits, and root crops such as monggo, bananas, jackfruit, sweet potatoes, ube, nata de coco, and young coconut.

</br></br>

        The delicious assortment is topped with shaved ice, milk, Leche flan, and ice cream. It’s also common to finish it off with a generous sprinkling of crispy pinipig or pounded rice for extra crunch.

</br></br>

        As its name suggests, the colorful add-ins are mixed into a creamy and refreshing treat. Each component marries into an exciting medley of creamy, soft, chewy tastes and textures that’s like a party in your mouth!
